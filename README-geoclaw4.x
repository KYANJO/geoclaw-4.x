this is a repository for development of geoclaw4.x. It is based on clawpack4.x, but not forked from clawpack4.x. It contains many feature enhancements to clawpack4.x/geoclaw., not it clawpack4.x. Since we don't anticipate adding those changes to clawpack4.x, they are contained in this separate repository.

Later I anticipate adding these features to clawpack5.0. However, they are not yet compatible with clawpack5.0. ...they are compatible with clawpack4.x. Hence the reason for a separate repository.

For users of geoclaw only, particularly for overland flood modeling, this repository might be ideal until clawpack5.0/geoclaw is fully functional. For tsunami modeling, clawpack4.x is probably best.
